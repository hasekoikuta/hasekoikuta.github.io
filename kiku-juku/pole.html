<div style="fontsize:15px;">I just eat a balanced diet and take regular exercise.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">If you want to lose your weight, the first thing I recommend is walking every morning and avoiding junk food</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I think I might have a temperature.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">You should make sure you het plenty of rest for a few days.</div>

<div style="fontsize:15px;">I hear you're going to Nara.</div>

<div style="fontsize:15px;">How long will you be there?</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">How was your winter vacation?</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I spent several days skiing and snowbording in Hokkaido</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I've never been to Hokkaido, but I'd love to go there someday.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">Did you hear about the typhoon that hit Tiwan last week?</div>

<div style="fontsize:15px;">More than 100 people were killed, and many more were injured.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">What do you do to reduce waste?</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">The easiest way is to reduce waste by reusing and recycling products.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">Plant and animals species are dying out all over the world.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I heard just the other day that a fish called medaka is becoming to endangered</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">Fish in general are threatened by overfishing.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I know French is one of the Canada's official languages.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I learned it as a second language in school, but I'm not at it all fluent.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">How do you say itadakimasu in English?</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">It seems there are quite a few words that can't be translated directly from one languages to another</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">I often hear Australia described as a multicultural nation.</div>
<div style="fontsize:15px;">We certainly continue to accept large numbers of immigrants from around the world.</div>
